## How to write a new post

Create a new file in [_posts](https://github.com/hugh-braico/hugh-braico.github.io/tree/master/_posts). Copy the last one as a guide. 

If you want to upload images as part of a post put them in [_images](https://github.com/hugh-braico/hugh-braico.github.io/tree/master/images), then you can embed them in Markdown like this

```text
![Check out this cool image](images/my_cool_image.png)
```
