I've decided to actually give learning Japanese a proper go again, and I thought
it might be interesting to chronicle my learning journey through these blog posts,
so I can look back on them and see how far I've come.

## Why learn Japanese?

I have a handful of reasons:

* I'm hoping to travel to Japan and feel a bit less like a totally lost, isolated
  foreigner. Watching videos from people like Xiaoma on YouTube learning people's
  language and connecting with native speakers made me envious! It's really
  amazing how much warmer people are when you make the effort to learn their
  language.
* I have an appreciation for Japanese culture (especially the food) and knowing
  the language would go hand-in-hand with that.
* It would be interesting to be able to appreciate Japanese content like anime
  and manga in its native language
  * Admittedly, it will be many years of study before I'm able to appreciate it 
    to the same level as I would with English subtitles.
  * Also admittedly I'm not the hugest anime or manga fan out there, but there are
    at least a handful of different series I'd like to get around to
    watching/reading sometime.
* I'm interested in language and the process of language learning, and Japanese
  is apparently one of the most difficult languages to learn for English speakers.
  Challenge accepted, I suppose!
* I'd like to know what it's like to actually *think* in another language. 
* I happen to be born in Japan due to my dad being an expat at the time and people
  always ask "Do you have Japanese citizenship / can you speak Japanese?". Would be
  nice to answer "yes" to at least one of those questions.
* I learned a *little bit* of Japanese in high school (I took a class for it in 8th
  and 9th grade), but not enough to be really useful. It would be a shame to let that
  potential base for something useful go to waste.
* JLPT N1 certification looks good on a resume, even though I probably won't use it.
 
## How much Japanese do I know *right now?*
 
Very little, but still better than starting from completely nothing.

* I know most of the hiragana, and like 70% of the katakana. I know barely any
  kanji (numbers 1-10, Êó•Êú¨Ë™û, and that's about it)
* My vocab is maybe 20 basic words - student, mother, school, etc.
* I know some VERY basic grammar like„ÄÄ„ÅØ„ÄÄand „ÅÆ, „Äú„Åß„Åô/„Äú„Åæ„Åô, etc.

I knew a little bit more than that in high school, but that was 10+ years ago, so...

## *How* will I be learning Japanese?

I formed my strategy by reading the [Refold Roadmap](https://refold.la/roadmap/)
and the [DJT guide](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/learn/guide), as well as watching
YouTube videos by people such as
[Matt vs Japan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpf4BknRWAjb_oYIHoMDGVg).

* Kana: Polish off my kana knowledge using an Anki deck.
  * I don't imagine this will take longer than a week, after that I should be able
    to passively revise my kana while doing other study methods.
* Vocab: Anki Core 2K/6K Optimized Japanese Vocabulary, 10 new cards/day.
  * This deck seems really good, it has a bunch of common, useful words as well as
    example sentences spoken clearly by a native speaker.
* Kanji: Heisig's Remember The Kanji, 6th edition.
  * Mnemonic-based approach to kanji learning that learns them in the ideal order
    for retention (building up primitives on each other), rather than starting with
    the most commonly-used kanji.
  * I found an Anki deck for this as well that has extra mnemonics from Koohii.
    Going to try to do this with 10 new cards/day as well.
  * You still need the book to follow along with as you go, because it talks about
    some stuff that isn't in the flash cards.
* Grammar study: Tae Kim guide, read a couple sections every day.
  * Once finishing the guide, revisit it as a reference, but otherwise learn and
    reinforce grammar through immersion.
* Immersion: watching anime on Animelon with Japanese subtitles only
  * I've picked out some simpler, slice of life anime to watch. Slide of life shows
    generally feature simpler, slower dialogue that uses more practical vocabulary
    and is spoken in a more natural fashion.
  * I won't be able to understand a whole lot starting out, but I'll train my ear
    to parse Japanese sentences and words, and occasionally I'll be able to pick
    out occasional words, expressions and kanji that I've picked up in my other
    studies.
  * Refold's philosophy insists that you must accept ambiguity and keep on trucking.
    Perfect comprehension is impossible anyway, so just let the language wash over
    you and pick out what you can, it will only get easier and easier as you get
    used to it.

Across all of these I'm hoping to commit about 1 hour or so per day, but we'll
see how we go. 

Later on when my grammar and vocab is stronger, I'll start "intensive" immersion
where I pick apart every sentence in an anime/manga and try to at least
mostly understand it.

I'm not going to worry at all about speaking or writing for at least several months
until I build a strong foundation of comprehension.

See you at the 30 day mark. üëã
