I'm (about) 30 days into learning Japanese, here's my update.

## Vocab and kanji

* I'm about 300 cards into Core 2K, but my retention rate is pretty low
  (like 60-70%), so my "true" vocab is maybe closer to like 200 words. A lot of
  kanji still look like arbitrary squiggles, so they're hard to remember. Words
  that have kanji I'm familiar with are much more likely to be retained, so I
  expect that my retention rate will slowly rise as my kanji improves.
  * I read that the deck is actually quite old so I had a look through and
    already suspended some antiquated words like "cassette tape"
    and "typewriter". I'll probably just learn modern words like "smartphone"
    through immersion.
  * The word ‰∏äÊâã came up in my deck... the bane of every Japanese learner... üòü
* About 300 cards into the RTK deck with a respectable 90% ish retention. The
  mnemonics and stories help a lot for retention.
  * RTK isn't in order of usefulness though (it's in an order Heisig thinks is
    best for learning all of them), so I know a lot of kanji that aren't coming
    up at all in vocab or immersion. This is a bit annoying in the short term,
    but hopefully it'll all come out in the wash later.
* For both decks, 10 new cards/day seems to be a decent daily workload.

These things have helped a lot:

* [AnkiDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki) +
  [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net) - These rule, being able to sync my Anki
  progress between desktop and mobile and do them wherever I want is awesome.
* [Anki Review Heatmap](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1771074083) - If nothing
  else, this extension really makes me want to not break my streak of doing
  reviews every day. It also gives me a good summary of how many cards I'm
  looking at every day.

* [Yomichan browser extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yomichan/) - 
  great for looking up unknown words at a glance by just holding Shift and
  mousing over them.
* [Akebi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craxic.akebifree) -
  I'm sure there are plenty of good Japanese dictionaries on Android but this
  one is pretty good and you can launch it from the context menu after
  highlighting text to quickly look up words.

## Grammar

* I'm about 100 "sections" into Tae Kim, or about 40% of the way by length. It's
  getting there, but there are still a lot of important concepts I've yet to
  learn about and a few that I've already kinda forgotten and need to revise.
* Verb conjugations are easily the hardest thing about Japanese grammar so far,
  so many rules and exceptions for different kinds of verbs and I haven't even
  gotten into keigo yet.
* It's encouraging being able to sight-read more and more of the example
  sentences without checking the vocab guide first!

## Immersion

* Doing some "let the language wash over me" immersion by watching Shirokuma
  Cafe on Animelon with Japanese subtitles. The anime is reasonably
  entertaining even though I'm sometimes not sure what's going on. „Éö„É≥„ÇÆ„É≥ is my
  favourite character.
* I'm picking out some words, kanji, and grammar structures out of most lines,
  and sometimes understanding entire sentences (mostly very simple ones).
* The meaning of most long sentences is totally lost on me, though.
* I feel like I'm probably getting a better feel for hearing where words start
  and end, and literally knowing more Japanese words is helping with that as
  well.
* I thought loanwords would be easy wins for comprehension, but they're REALLY
  not! Loanwords are genuinely hard to identify, especially when you can't even
  be sure that they're even loaned from English. One of the only words I looked
  up was „Éê„Ç§„Éà (part-time job), which is from the *German* "arbeit"... I spent
  almost a whole episode wondering why the characters were talking about biting
  things... üò¢

### Immersion strategy/philosophy

* Like I mentioned in the first post, once I have a stronger base of grammar and
  vocab I'll start to do "intensive" or "studious" immersion, where I pause and
  pick apart every line.
* From what I've read, when doing "intensive" immersion, speed is more important
  than understanding every line to the absolute best of your ability. That is
  to say, understand the general idea behind the sentence if you can, but if
  there is some unusual grammar structure or nuanced use of vocabulary you
  don't understand, it's better to simply move on rather than dwell on it.
  While I was initially surprised, I agree with that logic. The reasons for
  this are:
  * If the parts you're not understanding are actually important (ie. frequently
    used), then they will come up again anyway, and you'll have another chance
    to learn the meaning.
  * Going quickly helps you literally absorb *more of the language* per unit of
    time.
  * Going quickly is simply more fun than getting bogged down in specifics,
    which helps with motivation to continue learning. If it isn't fun then you
    won't want to do it next time, and there's no Japanese Immersion Heatmap
    plugin with a streak you really don't want to break (but maybe there should
    be...)
  * Going quickly helps keep up your "flow state" when consuming the media. This
    helps you follow the plot and context, thereby boosting your comprehension
    of the media. If you just spent 25 minutes looking up some obscure grammar
    structure, you probably forgot a bunch of details about what's actually
    going on in the story.

### Some stuff I might want to immerse with

* Some anime that are on Animelon that I'm interested in watching:
  * Nichijou
  * Haikyuu!!
  * FMA Brotherhood
  * Samurai Champloo
* These anime aren't on Animelon and I don't know where to get them with
  Japanese subtitles, so they might be a later-down-the-line goal for
  audio-only practice:
  * Tamako Market
  * Cowboy Bebop (I've already watched this with English subs before)
  * A rewatch of a bunch of the Ghibli movies
  * Definitely more, I just haven't given it enough thought yet
* Some manga I'd like to give a try:
  * Yotsubato!
  * Spy x Family
  * Original Dragonball
  * Like the above, definitely more, just need to think about it some more.
* Some video games I've been thinking about playing in Japanese:
  * Dark Souls 1 is my favourite video game of all time, and while it doesn't
    have much dialogue there is a lot of reading to do. Would definitely try a
    Japanese playthrough where I read every item description and such.
  * After playing quite a lot of the original Animal Crossing on GameCube, I've
    always felt the series was a bit of a time waster, but I think it's a much
    better time-value proposition if it comes with a side dish of language
    practice. Might try the new one on Nintendo Switch.
  * Ghost Trick has simple vocab and is apparently a cool little game that I'd
    probably enjoy. I have a friend who would be very happy to know that I
    tried it.
  * Persona 4 is a common recommendation for Japanese language learners. I
    dunno, the story part seems appealing enough but I hope the JRPG combat
    doesn't kill it for me...
  * Yakuza 0 might be fun.
  * Metal Gear Solid 1 would be a really interesting game to tackle in Japanese
    just because of how infamously different the English dub is.
  * Chrono Trigger is a game that I love that is dialogue-heavy, and it
    apparently has a
    [transcript available in Japanese online](https://kwhazit.ucoz.net/trans/ct/index.html)
    so you can look up words with Yomichan, so that's appealing.
    * I originally played it on SNES, but I think the Steam version is worth
      playing now since they added the option to turn off the ugly filtering.
  * Ni No Kuni is apparently a very approachable game that seems cute.
  * The Witcher 3 has full Japanese dub AND subs, but I don't think it's
    press-to-continue style dialogue, so it might be difficult.

I found something called [Game2Text](https://game2text.com/) which is like a
collection of utilities for helping to parse dialogue while playing video games
in Japanese, which will make things a bit smoother on PC. Definitely going to
make use of this where I can.

## Mentality

* I feel like I've made some good progress for about 30 hours of study, but
  still have a long way to go, of course. My outlook is pretty positive and I
  think I could really get somewhere if I keep things up, just have to keep on
  trucking with it. 
* This feels like something that you can only build up over a long period of
  time and will just start slipping away from you if you ever stop practising,
  which is a bit frustrating to acknowledge, but what can you do.
* The idea of speaking and forming my own sentences in real time seems
  scary/difficult and feels extremely far away. Not only do I have to retrieve
  vocab, I need to fit it all together with grammar *and* speak it with pitch
  accent that doesn't sound weird? Yikes! That's all for far-in-the-future me
  to worry about, though.

## Next update, and goal setting

I'll probably do quarterly posts from now on (3 months, 6 months, 9 months etc),
unless there's really something I want to rant about. They'll probably be a bit
shorter than this one.

### Goals for 3 month mark

* Don't break Anki streak for reviews. Keep up the 10 cards/day on average.
  * Adjust new cards to 0 if it's a very busy day, and make it up over the next
    few days.
* Finish first read through of Tae Kim.
* Start intensive immersion, breaking down each sentence and try to understand
  it

General thoughts about goals:

* I don't really want to set any specific goals for actual proficiency yet, just
  keeping up a decent workload and working in the right direction. Wherever I
  end up is wherever I end up.
* However, if we end up doing that ski trip to Japan next January (~12 month
  mark of learning Japanese for me), it would be good to be as proficient with
  my reading, listening and speaking as possible. I'm most concerned about the
  speaking part.
