I'm about 30 days into learning Japanese and I've made some good progress for about 30
hours of study, but still have a long way to go ahead of me.

## Vocab and kanji

* I'm about 300 cards into Core 2K, but my retention rate is pretty low (like 60-70%),
  so my "true" vocab is maybe closer to like 200 words. A lot of kanji still look like
  arbitrary squiggles, so they're hard to remember. Words that have kanji I'm familiar
  with are much more likely to be retained, so I expect that my retention rate will
  slowly rise as my kanji improves.
* The word 上手 came up in my deck... the bane of every Japanese learner... 
* About 300 cards into the RTK deck with a more respectable 85% ish retention. RTK isn't
  in order of usefulness though (it's in an order Heisig thinks is best for learning all
  of them), so I know a lot of kanji that aren't coming up at all in vocab or immersion.

Memory is weird, the way information is indexed in your head is really strange sometimes.
I wish I could run SQL queries on the database of my own brain.

## Grammar

* I'm about 90 "sections" into Tae Kim. It's getting there, but there are still a lot
  of important concepts I've yet to learn about.
* I'll need to go back to some parts, especially the ones about verb conjugation rules.

## Immersion

Doing some "let the language wash over me" immersion by watching Shirokuma Cafe on Animelon
with Japanese subtitles. I'm picking out some words and kanji out of most lines, and
sometimes understanding entire sentences (mostly very simple ones, like 何それ？). The
meaning of most long sentences is totally lost on me, though.

Like I mentioned in the first post, once I have a stronger base of grammar and vocab I'll
start to pause and pick apart every line.

## Some useful stuff I've found

* AnkiDroid and AnkiWeb - These rule, being able to sync my Anki progress between desktop
  and mobile and do them wherever I want is very convenient.
* Anki heatmap extension - If nothing else this thing really makes me want to not break
  my streak.
* Akebi dictionary on Android
* Google Japanese IME

## Next update

Next couple updates will be 3 and 6 months, probably.
