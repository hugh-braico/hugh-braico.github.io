I'm about 3 months into learning Japanese, here's my update.

## Vocab and kanji

* On track with my goals in the last update, I've been maintaining 10 cards/day
  in each of my Core2K and RTK decks. I've learned almost 1000 kanji and 1000
  vocabulary words! (Not quite, but close)

* Number of review cards is slowly creeping up as I increase my backlog, which
  is inevitable if retention is constant, but I think the words are getting
  more difficult/complex/obscure as well which is making the problem worse. The
  kanji deck is not as bad because the kanji are in practically random order, so
  they're not getting more complex over time, just more numerous.
* I was right about my kanji study helping along my vocab retention, words
  usually don't look like random squiggles any more which has helped a lot. I
  even have a decent shot at guessing the reading and/or meaning of a new word
  if it contains only kanji I've seen before. Can't wait to get up to ~2300
  kanji so I have a shot at guessing the meaning of almost any word I come
  across, if not also the reading.
* On desktop, [jisho](https://jisho.org/search/%20%23kanji) has been very useful
  for looking up kanji that come up in vocab that I haven't seen before,
  especially since the Core2K deck really likes to introduce words in batches
  that feature the same kanji character.
* On mobile,
  [akebi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.craxic.akebifree)'s
  highlight context menu option has been excellent for picking up the meanings
  of kanji in vocab words quickly (it's faster than copy pasting into jisho).
* I love throwing in images of pop culture references or memes into my cards to
  help me remember them better.

* I also like using DALL-E to sometimes throw in some random AI art, especially
  if the story is so farfetched that there would be no chance of finding
  something on Google Images or similar.

## Grammar

* I've been a bit too busy to fully finish Tae Kim (so that's a fail on my goal
  of finishing it at 3 months, sadly) but I got about 175 sections in out of
  230-ish. This is probably far enough to start immersing since I'll need to go
  back to Tae Kim a ton of times for reference anyway.
* I think I mostly comprehended everything I saw as I went, but it's going to
  need a lot of seeing it in the wild and a lot of repetition in order to
  really get it in long term memory.

## Immersion

* I had a goal to start "intensive" or "studious" immersion before the 3 month
  mark so I just started reading Yotsubato Volume 1 using the Reading Pack.
  It's hard and slow, but the Reading Pack helps a lot for reference. Once I
  get more grammar actually into my head hopefully I'll build up something
  resembling a pace.
* I'd like to also pick up Persona 4 or Chrono Trigger soon.
* I've heard about graded reading material (basically: reading children's
  stories) but that honestly seems really boring. I'd like the media I engage
  with to be interesting even if I have to extract it drop by drop using the
  mental equivalent of a toothpick.

## Mentality

* I feel like the progress is about as expected, but the "ways to go ahead"
  still looks extremely vast. Language is hard, who would have thunk...

## Next update, and goal setting

Like I said in the previous post, I'll do quarterly posts from now on (6 months,
9 months etc), unless there's really something I want to rant about. They'll
probably get shorter and shorter as I go.

### Goals for 6 month mark

* Same as last time: Don't break Anki streak for reviews. Keep up the 10
  cards/day on each deck on average.
  * Adjust new cards down if it's a very busy day, and make it up over the next
    few days.
* Actually-actually finish Tae Kim, but for real this time.
* Keep immersing at least a couple times every week (every day is probably more
  than I can manage, unfortunately)
