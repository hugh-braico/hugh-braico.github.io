Oops, I meant to update more frequently than this, but here's my ~1 year update
on learning Japanese. My Japanese study has unfortunately fallen a little bit
by the wayside. I'd like to be able to tell you that it's because of:

* Moving out with my partner which has been super busy and stressful
* Getting promoted at work meaning more responsibilities
* Picking up piano as yet another hobby (oops)
* A bunch of different programming projects taking up my attention
* No longer planning on visiting Japan any time soon (My friends can't afford
  it...) which has removed a lot of the urgency in learning any
  reading/speaking skills
* A slew of great video games like Helldivers 2 and Dragon's Dogma 2 coming out

All of those things did happen, but the harsh reality is that I could have
managed my time a little better and prioritised Japanese study more, but
didn't. This post is pretty much just scolding myself for not trying harder.

## Vocab and kanji

* I've kept up my streak on both kanji and vocab for more than a
  year. I now "know" about 1800 kanji and 1700 vocabulary words. I'm pretty
  close to learning all ~2100 joyo kanji.
* I've cut down my daily words/kanji to just 3 new cards per day.
  Some days, when things are particularly hectic, I'll adjust the new cards to
  0 and just do reviews. The lower workload has definitely meant fewer cards done each day - I'm usually looking at about 120 cards per day on average.
* The streak heatmap has done a lot to keep me motivated to keep some level of
  consistency going, which is good. (Ignore that weird dark blip in 2023,
  that's a bug in the heatmap addon related to daylight savings time lol)

* I've been using Anki more on my phone lately, because the Akebi context menu
  search is just a bit easier than opening a Jisho browser window on desktop.
* A tip for people with a similar mentality to myself: hide the number of
  new/failed/review cards when in review mode now, as well as the "time
  remaining" estimate on the mobile version. I found myself looking at it a
  lot ("Is it over yet?"), which was just a waste of time. It's done when it's
  done! There's literally no point in agonising over how much is left, so don't
  show it.

## Immersion

* ああ, ええと。。。

* I've really dropped the ball on immersion - I've hardly done any, to be
  honest. I haven't prioritised the time to do it. Getting the momentum going
  on immersion is difficult. 

## Grammar

* ああ, ええと。。。

![Oops](images/ahh_eeto.gif)

* I did end up finishing my read through of Tae Kim, but I haven't retained most
  of it because I have barely put any of it to use. I need to start reading
  through it again AND encountering all these grammar structures in the wild to
  actually comprehend them properly.

### Goals

I'm going to be pretty easy and realistic with myself with goals going forward, at least for now:

* Keep up Anki as-is, no change in pace.
* Try and find time at least once a week for immersion.
